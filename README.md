This project presents a basic Speech Recognition System developed using Python and the SpeechRecognition library. The main objective of the system is to convert spoken language from a short audio clip into readable text using pre-trained speech recognition models. The program accepts a .wav audio file as input and processes it using the Recognizer class provided by the library. The recorded audio data is then sent to the Google Web Speech API, which is a powerful pre-trained model capable of accurately converting speech into text.

The system is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. It includes proper exception handling to manage common errors such as unclear speech, unsupported audio format, or internet connectivity issues. Once the speech is successfully recognized, the transcribed text is displayed on the screen.

This project demonstrates how modern speech-to-text technology works using existing APIs and libraries without building a model from scratch. It highlights the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in real-world systems such as virtual assistants, voice search engines, and automated transcription services.
